# 15 Puzzle Solver using Branch and Bound

## Introduction
This program is used for solving the  15-Puzzle problem. Example of a 15-Puzzle problem are as follows. Supposed  we had an initial state of:

```sh
1 2 12 3
5 6 8 4
13 9 11 15
10 16 7 14
```
This program utilized the branch and bound algorithm to  to turn that initial state to the goal state of:

```sh
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
```

This was a small project created in order to fulfill the requirements of IF2211 Algorithm Strategy course in Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB).

## Prerequisites
